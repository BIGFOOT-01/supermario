          During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the country of Japan
          underwent many changes internally, and was forced to alter their skill
          strengths from their notoriously ruthless military, to working towards
          producing technologically advanced products. In September of 1889,
          Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd., which
          originally produced handmade hanafuda cards. These cards became very
          popular in Japan, and after several decades of success, the cards were
          brought over to the U.S. by Fusajiro’s grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi. The
          cards were unsuccessful in America, causing Yamauchi to consider the
          fact that playing cards had become an out-of-date past time to
          Americans. They needed something more refreshing and original than the
          hanafuda cards. It wasn’t until Nintendo released the arcade game
          Donkey Kong to America that the video gaming industry truly started to
          take off and become popular amongst the people. Nintendo took the idea
          of playing an electronic video game in an arcade, and made it better
          by creating video games, gaming systems, and handheld devices
          available for Americans to buy, and to play in the comfort of their
          own home. The game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe was released in 1999 for
          the Game Boy Color, and was the first handheld gaming device that
          featured a color display. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe affected American
          culture during the turn of the 21st century by creating a demand in
          the video gaming industry, and by celebrating Mario as a gaming icon.
          As a culture, America has affected Super Mario Bros. Deluxe by
          providing more opportunities technological advancement, by pressuring
          Nintendo to generate new gaming ideas, yet still keeping the Super
          Mario Bros. originality throughout.
